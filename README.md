## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This is a **dynamic KYC (Know Your Customer) form** built in **React**. Instead of hardcoding fields, it reads a **JSON schema** and shows the right input type automatically. It also handles validation, multi-step navigation, and dark/light mode.

Basically, itâ€™s a form that adjusts itself based on the questions you define.

## ðŸ§  My Thought Process

- **Keep it dynamic** â€“ I designed the form to automatically adjust based on the JSON schema, making it easy to add new questions.

- **Validation separate from UI** â€“ All validation logic lives in `lib/validation.js`, keeping the form components clean and focused.

- **User experience** â€“ The multi-step layout, inline error messages, and local storage make it simple and frustration-free for users to fill out.

- **Reusable components** â€“ `FieldRenderer`, `Dropdown`, and `CustomDatePicker` are built to be reusable in other forms or projects.

- **Accessibility** â€“ Dark/light mode toggle, responsive design, and smooth stepper animations enhance both usability and visual appeal.
